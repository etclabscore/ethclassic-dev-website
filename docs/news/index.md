# The Ethereum Classic Atlantis Protocol-Upgrade

The Ethereum Classic community and developer stakeholders have agreed upon a bundle of protocol upgrades, code-named _Atlantis_. The hard fork to activate these features is scheduled to occur at block 8,772,000 around Sept. 17, 2019. The full schedule is as follows:

- Block 716,617 on Kotti Classic PoA-testnet around June 19, 2019.
- Block 4,729,274 on Morden Classic PoW-testnet around Jul 29, 2019.
- Block 8,772,000 on Ethereum Classic PoW-mainnet, around Sept 17, 2019.

To ensure a successful fork, we ask users to upgrade their clients to a fork-compatible version if they have not already done so. The specification proposed for the hard fork is being implemented in the following clients:

- [Classic-Geth](https://github.com/etclabscore/go-ethereum), version [6.0.2-alpha or later](https://github.com/etclabscore/go-ethereum/releases).
- [Multi-Geth](https://github.com/multi-geth/multi-geth), version [1.9.2 or later](https://github.com/multi-geth/multi-geth/releases).
- [Parity](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/releases), version [2.5.3-beta or later](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/releases).

The Atlantis Hard Fork specification is described in [ECIP-1054](https://github.com/ethereumproject/ECIPs/blob/master/ECIPs/ECIP-1054.md). To learn more about Atlantis, the following resources will be helpful:

## Contribute to testing

The [Kensington](https://github.com/eth-classic/kensington) testnet is a temporary Atlantis-enabled, proof-of-work testnet for Ethereum Classic. ETC contributors have been working deligiently for client readiness and ensuring the software safety for Atlantis. We strongly encourage other node operators to participate in Kensington testing.
